= Ext projects

The projects in this folder are special extension to Minimal-J. They may be incomplete or their
code is not as clean as the core of Minimal-J. I simply don't have the resources to keep everything
in a perfect state. Still these projects may be useful or provide a hint of what is possible with
Minimal-J.

The ext projets are not released to a maven repository and don't have a release management yet.

== memory

A Repository that keeps all data in the (VM) memory

== historized

A sql Repository with support for historized entities. If a main entity has a boolean field 'historized' then
with every version a new row is created in the database.

== swingfxbrowser

Enables the browser of JavaFx for the Swing Frontend.
As JavaFx is not part of OpenJDK (only in Oracle JDK) or Java 11 this class is separated in special artifact
to avoid the bunch of dependencies needed to run JavaFx. Just add this artifact to your application pom.xml.
If you then start the Swing Frontend the system browser will be used to display html content.

== servlet

This project allows to deploy Minimal-J applications to a java application server like tomcat.

== vaadin

This is a frontend implemented in vaadin. It doesn't provide more value than the web based
fronted included in Minimal-J. But certain aspects look a little bit better.

== lanterna

A terminal based frontend. Nice showcase but quite incomplete.

== metamodel

Generate a browseable metamodel from the entity classes of an application.

== rest

Expose the content of the repository as REST api.

== undertow

Uses undertow as server infrastructure. Supports WebSockets.

== nanohttpd

Uses nanoHttpd as server infrastructure. Supports WebSockets.

== thymeleaf

== soft

= Abandoned projects

== Vaadin 8 / Vaadin 8 Servlet / Vaadin 8 Springboot

Support for Vaadin 8 ends in 2022 (except paid LTS). Vaadin has moved away from gwt to web components.
