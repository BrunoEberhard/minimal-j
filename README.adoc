= Minimal-J

image::doc/frontends.png[title="Minimal-J"]

== Idea

Minimal-J is an opinionated java framework. The focus is:

* Small
* Easy to use
* Easy to specify
* No dependencies
* Works with Html / Vaadin / Swing / Terminal
* DB persistence
* be reactive

== Status

Sometimes when I look at other frameworks I think Minimal-J is quite mature.
But at the moment it is still more of a personal research project. I still
feel free to change major points. There is no 1.0 version yet.
