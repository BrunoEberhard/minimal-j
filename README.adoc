= Minimal-J

Minimal-J is an opinionated java framework. It covers client and server technologies.

* Small: The minimalj.jar is still < 1MB
* Makes applications easy to specify: Minimal-J reduces the choices an implentation has to make
* No required dependencies. Only the ones an application needs by itself
* Works with different UI technologies: Html / Vaadin / Swing / Terminal
* DB persistence, transactions and authorization

== Status

Sometimes when I look at other frameworks I think Minimal-J is quite mature.
But at the moment it is still more of a personal research project. I still
feel free to change major points. There is no 1.0 version yet.
