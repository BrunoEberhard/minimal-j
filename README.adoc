= Minimal-J

image::doc/frontends.png[title="Minimal-J"]

== Idea

Minimal-J is an opinionated java framework. The focus is:

* Small: The minimalj.jar is still < 1MB
* Easy to specify: Minimal-J reduces the choices an implentation has to make
* No required dependencies. Only the ones an application needs by itself
* Works with different UI technologies: Html / Vaadin / Swing / Terminal
* DB persistence: A very minimalized ORM

== Status

Sometimes when I look at other frameworks I think Minimal-J is quite mature.
But at the moment it is still more of a personal research project. I still
feel free to change major points. There is no 1.0 version yet.
