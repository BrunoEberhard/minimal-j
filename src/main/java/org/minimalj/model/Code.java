/**
 * Codes are small base entities of an application. Like currencies or cities.
 * They are mostly stable but there could be updates from time to time.
 * Typically there is an initial load after the repository (database) is
 * created.
 * <p>
 * 
 * For things like 'YES'/'NO' where there is no chance of change or updates at
 * all you better use enums.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A code is always a view. Meaning if a code is referenced in an entity the
 * code is not updated when persisting that entity.
 * <p>
 * 
 * As specialty codes can have a String or an Integer id field.
