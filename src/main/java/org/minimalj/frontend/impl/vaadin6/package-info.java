/**
 * Vaadin was used before the Json Frontend. It gets more and more outdated

 * everytime if the old stuff is still working.<p>
 * 
 * Missing parts:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>The navigation is still a menu. Should be a pane on the left as in Json Frontend</LI>
 * <LI>Vaadin Frontend shows only one page at a time instead of show detail pages below master pages</LI>
 * <LI>Html content</LI>
 * </UL>
