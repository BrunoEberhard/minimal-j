== Frontend details

=== Pages

Pages are one of the building blocks of an application. On small device they fill up the whole
display space. On a large display a main page can be accompanied by some depending detail
pages.

image::page_with_detail_large_device.png[title="Page with detail page on large device"]

image::page_with_detail_small_device.png[title="Page with detail page on small device"]

Most frontends provide back and forward buttons to navigate between pages.

Pages provide a title, content and sometimes actions. The content should be static.
This means the user cannot make any input on a page. Inputs should be done in a dialog.

=== Contents

There are only a few different implementations of IContent. For every class of content there
exists a corresponding Page class.

==== Table

Tables show a list of Objects of the same class. Minimal-J doesn't support inheritence for business classes so the objects
will be really of the same class. Tables are meant to be read only. The displayed objects cannot be edited directly in the table.
But tables can have a context menu with actions. And a row of table can be double clicked (or 'started' in the way the frontend
should do it according where it lives).

Table columns have all the same width. If this hurts too much it is possible to merge to fields of the business object in one column.

The most common way to create a table will be that you create a TablePage. TablePage needs the keys for the columns.
The keys are the $ constants from the business class.

==== Html

With html content you can break out from the constraints given by Minimal-J. A HtmlPage can display basically every URL or html
string. The frontends may depend on system funcionality for that. For example the SwingFrontend uses the JavaFX bridge to the system
browser. And for the web based frontend displaying web content is the easiest part.

Displaying html is meant to be used for start or help pages. Also report engines (not in scope for Minimal-J) could present their
reports. Of course the html pages could contain links and even input forms. But this is _not_ the way to extend the functionality
of Minimal-J or to circumvent its rules.

==== Form

Forms in Minimal-J have basically the same funtion as in HTML.
You define with a Form what fields of an entity are shown and in which order.
Fields can depend on each other. This could mean if a checkbox is selected some fields get editable.

There are no things like 'LayoutManagers'. Of course the order in which you add the fields define somehow
the later layout of the form. But you cannot set horizontal weights to a field. This makes all forms look very regular.

===== FormElement

FormElement objects represent the business side. Fields of an entity are 'bound' to a FormElement.
Minimal-J doesn't emphasize much on binding.

It's very important to note that a FormElement is _not_ a IComponent but _provides_ one. This
is necessary as the specifc implementations of the components depend on the chosen Frontend.

The framework provides the basic form elements like the ones for formatted strings, dates, numbers and enumerations. But
for more complex types you will define your one FormElement classes. Look at the existing examples how to do this!

=== Inputs / Components

Minimal-J doesn't try to have as many shiny components as possible. Where other frameworks are proud to present pages of predefined components
Minimal-J restricts you basically to texts, comboboxes and checkboxes (with some veriations).

The Frontend class acts a factory for all components. This makes sense as for differend frontends (web or rich client) different components have
to be created.

=== Texts

There are quiete a few options how to create a read only text field. It can be based on a simple string or on an action.

=== Editable Texts

* Single line
* Format
* Allowed characters
* Suggestions

=== Password field

=== ComboBox

=== CheckBox
