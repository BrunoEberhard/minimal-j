== Authorization
The authorization decides if a user is allowed to do something. Do something means in Minimal-J execute a
Transaction. Transactions are the communication between the frontend and the backend. This means the
authorization happens when the frontend sends the backend a Transaction to execute. Or in Java: 

[source,java,title="Backend.java"]
----
	[..]
	
	public final <T> T execute(Transaction<T> transaction) {
		if (Subject.hasPermission(transaction)) {
			return doExecute(transaction);
		} else {
			throw new IllegalStateException(transaction.getClass().getSimpleName() + " forbidden");
		}
	} 
----

This seems readable not only for the compiler. The Subject class knows who is logged in (in respect of
the current Thread). It also provides the method to check if a Transaction is allowed.

NOTE: There are two quite similar classes called Subject and User. Subject has more to do with who is
currently logged in and what roles are available. The User class is the model class for the database of
all users and their roles. Minimal-J doesn't depend on the link:http://shiro.apache.org/[Shiro] project but
tries to use more or less the same terminology.

=== Restrict Transactions
A Transcation can restrict execution to one or more roles by the Role Annotation:
[source,java]
----
@Role("Developer")
public class GenerateDemoDataTransaction implements Transaction<Serializable> {
	[..]
}
----
The Role annotation allows to list more than one role. Execution of the Transaction is granted as long
as the current Subject has *at least one* of the given roles.

=== Restrict entity classes
Not every read or insert needs a specialized Transaction. If you call read or insert on the Persistence
interface a generic Transaction is instantiated:
[source,java,title="DelegatePersistence.java"]
----
	[..]
	
	@Override
	public <T> List<T> read(Class<T> clazz, Criteria criteria, int maxResults) {
		List<T> result = backend.execute(new ReadCriteriaTransaction<T>(clazz, criteria, maxResults));
		return result;
	}
----

To restrict access on entities their classes can be annotated (TODO better example):
[source,java]
----
@Role("RoleB")
public class B {

	public B() {
	}
}
----
If the role name is specified then this role is need for all types of Transactions. For read, insert, update
and delete. But sometimes you may want to restrict only the write acess for some user. You can do this by annotate
different roles for the different types of Transactions (TODO better example):
[source,java]
----
@Role(value = "ReadRole")
@Role(transaction = TransactionType.UPDATE, value = {"UpdateRole"})
public class C {

	public C() {
	}

}
----

=== Package wide roles
The needed roles for a Transaction or a business entity can also be specified on a package level. You can
specifiy these roles in the package-info.java file. If you don't know about this file you may have a look at
the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-7.html[Oracle documentation]. The package-info.java
makes it possible to annotate the package.

The package Annotation only is used if there is no annotation on a class itself. In this way you can specify
the permission for most of your entities on a package level and only annotate the exception in the classes. This
is also a good idea so that you don't forget the permission of new classes.
[source,java,title="package-info.java"]
----
@Role("pkgRole")
@Role(transaction = TransactionType.READ, value = {"ReadPkgRole"})
@Role(transaction = TransactionType.UPDATE, value = {"UpdatePkgRole"})
package org.minimalj.security.permissiontest.pkgrole;

import org.minimalj.transaction.Role;
import org.minimalj.transaction.Transaction.TransactionType;
----
Note that packages don't inherit there roles from their parent. This would lead to a error-prone complexity.

== Authorization configuration
As for things this configuration is done via application properties. If the property MjUserFile is defined a
TextFileAuthorizaion is installed.

If no MjUserFile property is specified Minimal-J is look for the property MjAuthorization. It should provide a
class name of an Authorization implementation. A good candidate may be JaasAuthorization.

TODO further explanation and examples. For the moment please look at the Authorization class for more implementation details.
