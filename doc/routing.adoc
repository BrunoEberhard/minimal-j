= Routing

The name routing is based on the routing concept of Angular. But only the name. While routing is a
central concept in Angular it's more of a nice to have in Minimal-J. You can build a complex application
without routing and you will miss nothing.

In web application routing means you can enter an URL and will be forwarded to certain page.
Or the application does change the URL itself and then changes the browser content accordingly.
In Minimal-J the application can show a page directly. A page can have a complex state and this
state could not be serialized in a readable String for the URL.

== Principle

In Minimal-J a page can signify that it can addressed with a route. This route is a String which
the application object should be able to parse the String a show redisplay the same page.

Not all a pages must have a route. The pages displaing main entites are better candidates than detail
pages.

== Route

The Route - String of a page must fulfill certain rules:
 * no '/' at start or end
 * Only characters or digits or the four characters .-_/ are allowed
 * Before a '/' no '.' is allowed

This rules are validated with the Page.validateRoute method.
If a page provides a invalid route the route is ignored without warning.

These rules are a security measure because routes are used in the URL.

== Example
Here a simplified example from OpenEch. First the page showing a person:

[source,java,title="PersonPage.java"]
----
	@Override
	public String getRoute() {
		return "person/" + getObjectId();
	}
----

and now the relevant method in the application class:

[source,java,title="OpenEchApplication.java"]
----
	@Override
	public Page createPage(String route) {
		String[] elements = route.split("/");
		if (elements.length >= 2) {
			switch (elements[0]) {
			case "person": return new PersonPage(elements[1]);
			}
		}
		return null;
	}
----

When displaying a person you may notice the changing URL:

image::routing_person.png[title="URL when displaying a routable page"]

This URL can be bookmarked and directly accessed from the bookmark menu in the browser.
